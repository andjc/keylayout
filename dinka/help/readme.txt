What follows is a rough instruction for downloading the Dinka Keyboard for MAC users. Please if you are using windows then treat this as you would an email from someone who declares himself to be from Nigeria and that he has a business proposal for you ;-)

----------------------------------------------
The file that contains the keyboard is not available online as I type and I am sure experts such as Andrew Cunningham may be working on making it downloadable online. But if Andrew is fine with it, I can send out the file so that you can download it from your email. The file itself is useless unless you understand and will be able to follow what I will write down here.

Let's assume you have downloaded the file.

1. Once the file is downloaded on your computer, the download window will pop up on your screen and the name of the folder that you just downloaded will be visible. Double click on the folder to see what is in it. The file called "dinka.keylayout" will be one of the files in the folder.

2. Leave the downloads window open but minimize everything else so that you a clear desktop screen.

3. Double Click on the "Macintosh HD" icon

4. You must be the administrator of your computer in order to be able to do this. If you are, then click on "administratorname" for example for my computer the word in quote reads "danielakech" with no quote.

5. Under the administratorname Click on the LIBRARY folder

6. Under library double click on KEYBOARD LAYOUTS folder to open it. It could be empty.

7. Now go back to the downloads window and grab "dinka.keylayout" and drag it and drop it into the KEYBOARD LAYOUTS.

8. Now close everything and log out of your computer.

9. Log back on.

10. Click on the System Preferences tab located on the bottom of your screen [usually].

11. Double click on the LANGUAGE and TEXT [usually with a flag symbol]

12. Click on INPUT SOURCES

13. Scroll through the list of languages all the way to D and you should be able to bump into "Dinka". Check the box next to Dinka by clicking on it.

14. Close everything. You now have the Dinka Keyboard on your computer.

Where is it? The top right corner of your screen should have a flag [e.g US flag]. That tells you the language the keyboard is switched onto. So click on the flag and you should be able to see Dinka. Click on Dinka and now your keyboard is in Dinka mode.

To test it, open for example Microsoft word and then make sure you have Dinka checked so that the dinka keyboard will work. Then type "Q" and you should see "Å‹". The rest can be gotten by typing s, x, and f. To place dots above a vowel, you just press down alt option key while pressing the letter you want.

You now have your Dinka keyboard.
